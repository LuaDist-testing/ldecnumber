/*
SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a
working copy, excluding externals. Then the highest revision
number found is used to replace all occurrences of "$""WCREV$"
in SrcVersionFile and the result is saved to DstVersionFile.
The commit date/time of the highest revision is used to replace
all occurrences of "$""WCDATE$". The modification status is used
to replace all occurrences of "$""WCMODS?TrueText:FalseText$" with
TrueText if there are local modifications, or FalseText if not.
